# VoiceNote

In this project, we developed a note-taking app that allows users to take notes with voice inputs. After singup, users could save new notes and view all the previous notes and its corresponding recordings. We also provided text understanding features including sentiment analysis, Named-entity recognition (NER), and content classification to let users analyze their notes. 

We built the web application using MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), Redis, Passport.js, Bootstrap, Web Speech API, MediaRecorder API, Google Natural Language API, and AWS S3.  
### Built With
* [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) - To store raw audio recording files.
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - NoSQL database.
* [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) - Web application framework for Node.js. 
* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) - Building frontend interfaces.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Open source server environment.
* [Redis](https://redis.io/) - In-memory data structure store to cache analysis results for application speedup.
* [Passport.js](https://expressjs.com/) - Authentication middleware for Node.js.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Front-end component library.
* [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) - For speech recognition and real time transcribe.
* [MediaRecorder API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream_Recording_API) - Record input voice stream. 
* [Google Natural Language API](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/) - Derive insights from text using Google machine learning.
* [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) - Project management.
